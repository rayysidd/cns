Message: Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly
normal, thank you very much. They were the last people you’d expect to be involved in anything
strange or mysterious, because they just didn’t hold with such nonsense.
Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made drills. He was a big, beefy
man with hardly any neck, although he did have a very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin
and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she
spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbors. The Dursleys
had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere.
The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and their greatest fear was
that somebody would discover it. They didn’t think they could bear it if anyone found out about
the Potters. Mrs. Potter was Mrs. Dursley’s sister, but they hadn’t met for several years; in fact,
Mrs. Dursley pretended she didn’t have a sister, because her sister and her good-for-nothing
husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think what the
neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street. The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a
small son, too, but they had never even seen him. This boy was another good reason for keeping
the Potters away; they didn’t want Dudley mixing with a child like that.
When Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray Tuesday our story starts, there was
nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon
be happening all over the country. Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for
work, and Mrs. Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high
chair.
None of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past the window.
At half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked Mrs. Dursley on the cheek, and
tried to kiss Dudley good-bye but missed, because Dudley was now having a tantrum and
throwing his cereal at the walls.
“Little tyke,” chortled Mr. Dursley as he left the house. He got into his car and backed out of
number four’s drive.
It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar — a cat

reading a map. For a second, Mr. Dursley didn’t realize what he had seen — then he jerked his
head around to look again. There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive, but
there wasn’t a map in sight. What could he have been thinking of? It must have been a trick of
the light. Mr. Dursley blinked and stared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley drove around
the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It was now reading the sign that said
Privet Drive — no, looking at the sign; cats couldn’t read maps or signs. Mr. Dursley gave
himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind. As he drove toward town he thought of
nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day.
But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something else. As he sat in the
usual morning traffic jam, he couldn’t help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely
dressed people about. People in cloaks. Mr. Dursley couldn’t bear people who dressed in funny
clothes — the getups you saw on young people! He supposed this was some stupid new fashion.
He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos
standing quite close by. They were whispering excitedly together. Mr. Dursley was enraged to
see that a couple of them weren’t young at all; why, that man had to be older than he was, and
wearing an emerald-green cloak! The nerve of him! But then it struck Mr. Dursley that this was
probably some silly stunt —these people were obviously collecting for something... yes, that
would be it. The traffic moved on and a few minutes later, Mr. Dursley arrived in the Grunnings
parking lot, his mind back on drills.
Mr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor. If he hadn’t,
he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning. He didn’t see the owls
swooping past in broad daylight, though people down in the street did; they pointed and gazed
open-mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead. Most of them had never seen an owl even at
nighttime. Mr. Dursley, however, had a perfectly normal, owl-free morning. He yelled at five
different people. He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more. He was in a
very good mood until lunchtime, when he thought he’d stretch his legs and walk across the road
to buy himself a bun from the bakery.
He’d forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the baker’s.
He eyed them angrily as he passed. He didn’t know why, but they made him uneasy. This bunch
were whispering excitedly, too, and he couldn’t see a single collecting tin. It was on his way
back past them, clutching a large doughnut in a bag, that he caught a few words of what they
were saying.
“The Potters, that’s right, that’s what I heard —”
“ — yes, their son, Harry —”
Mr. Dursley stopped dead. Fear flooded him. He looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to
say something to them, but thought better of it.
He dashed back across the road, hurried up to his office, snapped at his secretary not to disturb
him, seized his telephone, and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his
mind. He put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache, thinking... no, he was being

stupid. Potter wasn’t such an unusual name. He was sure there were lots of people called Potter
who had a son called Harry. Come to think of it, he wasn’t even sure his nephew was called
Harry. He’d never even seen the boy. It might have been Harvey. Or Harold. There was no point
in worrying Mrs. Dursley; she always got so upset at any mention of her sister. He didn’t blame
her — if he’d had a sister like that... but all the same, those people in cloaks...
He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when he left the building at
five o’clock, he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door.
“Sorry,” he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell. It was a few seconds before
Mr. Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak. He didn’t seem at all upset at
being almost knocked to the ground. On the contrary, his face split into a wide smile and he said
in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare, “Don’t be sorry, my dear sir, for nothing could
upset me today! Rejoice, for You-Know-Who has gone at last! Even Muggles like yourself
should be celebrating, this happy, happy day!”
And the old man hugged Mr. Dursley around the middle and walked off.
Mr. Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been hugged by a complete stranger. He also
thought he had been called a Muggle, whatever that was. He was rattled. He hurried to his car
and set off for home, hoping he was imagining things, which he had never hoped before, because
he didn’t approve of imagination.
As he pulled into the driveway of number four, the first thing he saw—and it didn’t improve his
mood — was the tabby cat he’d spotted that morning. It was now sitting on his garden wall. He
was sure it was the same one; it had the same markings around its eyes.
“Shoo!” said Mr. Dursley loudly.
The cat didn’t move. It just gave him a stern look. Was this normal cat behavior? Mr. Dursley
wondered. Trying to pull himself together, he let himself into the house. He was still determined
not to mention anything to his wife.
Mrs. Dursley had had a nice, normal day. She told him over dinner all about Mrs. Next Door’s
problems with her daughter and how Dudley had learned a new word (“Won’t!”). Mr. Dursley
tried to act normally. When Dudley had been put to bed, he went into the living room in time to
catch the last report on the evening news:
“And finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported that the nation’s owls have been behaving
very unusually today. Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight,
there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise.
Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern.” The
newscaster allowed himself a grin. “Most mysterious. And now, over to Jim McGuffin with the
weather. Going to be any more showers of owls tonight, Jim?”
“Well, Ted,” said the weatherman, “I don’t know about that, but it’s not only the owls that have

been acting oddly today. Viewers as far apart as Kent, Yorkshire, and Dundee have been
phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday, they’ve had a downpour of
shooting stars! Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early — it’s not until next
week, folks! But I can promise a wet night tonight.”
Mr. Dursley sat frozen in his armchair. Shooting stars all over Britain? Owls flying by daylight?
Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place? And a whisper, a whisper about the Potters...
Mrs. Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea. It was no good. He’d have to
say something to her. He cleared his throat nervously. “Er — Petunia, dear — you haven’t heard
from your sister lately, have you?”
As he had expected, Mrs. Dursley looked shocked and angry. After all, they normally pretended
she didn’t have a sister.
“No,” she said sharply. “Why?”
“Funny stuff on the news,” Mr. Dursley mumbled. “Owls... shooting stars... and there were a lot
of funny-looking people in town today...”
“So?” snapped Mrs. Dursley.
“Well, I just thought... maybe... it was something to do with... you know... her crowd.”
Mrs. Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. Mr. Dursley wondered whether he dared tell her
he’d heard the name “Potter.” He decided he didn’t dare. Instead he said

“Their son — he’d be about Dudley’s age now, wouldn’t he?”
“I suppose so,” said Mrs. Dursley stiffly.
“What’s his name again? Howard, isn’t it?”
“Harry. Nasty, common name, if you ask me.”
“Oh, yes,” said Mr. Dursley, his heart sinking horribly. “Yes, I quite agree.”
He didn’t say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed. While Mrs. Dursley was
in the bathroom, Mr. Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front
garden. The cat was still there. It was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for
something.
Was he imagining things? Could all this have anything to do with the Potters? If it did... if it got
out that they were related to a pair of — well, he didn’t think he could bear it.
The Dursleys got into bed. Mrs. Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr. Dursley lay awake, turning it
all over in his mind. His last, comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters

were involved, there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs. Dursley. The Potters
knew very well what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind... He couldn’t see how
he and Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on — he yawned and turned
over — it couldn’t affect them...
How very wrong he was.
Mr. Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep, but the cat on the wall outside was
showing no sign of sleepiness. It was sitting as still as a statue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the
far corner of Privet Drive. It didn’t so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next
street, nor when two owls swooped overhead. In fact, it was nearly midnight before the cat
moved at all.
A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching, appeared so suddenly and silently
you’d have thought he’d just popped out of the ground. The cat’s tail twitched and its eyes
narrowed.
Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive. He was tall, thin, and very old,
judging by the silver of his hair and beard, which were both long enough to tuck into his belt. He
was wearing long robes, a purple cloak that swept the ground, and high-heeled, buckled boots.
His blue eyes were light, bright, and sparkling behind half-moon spectacles and his nose was
very long and crooked, as though it had been broken at least twice. This man’s name was Albus
Dumbledore.
Albus Dumbledore didn’t seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything
from his name to his boots was unwelcome. He was busy rummaging in his cloak, looking for
something. But he did seem to realize he was being watched, because he looked up suddenly at
the cat, which was still staring at him from the other end of the street. For some reason, the sight
of the cat seemed to amuse him. He chuckled and muttered, “I should have known.”
He found what he was looking for in his inside pocket. It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter.
He flicked it open, held it up in the air, and clicked it. The nearest street lamp went out with a
little pop. He clicked it again — the next lamp flickered into darkness. Twelve times he clicked
the Put-Outer, until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the
distance, which were the eyes of the cat watching him. If anyone looked out of their window
now, even beady-eyed Mrs. Dursley, they wouldn’t be able to see anything that was happening
down on the pavement. Dumbledore slipped the Put-Outer back inside his cloak and set off down
the street toward number four, where he sat down on the wall next to the cat. He didn’t look at it,
but after a moment he spoke to it.
“Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall.”
He turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone. Instead he was smiling at a rather severe-looking
woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had
around its eyes. She, too, was wearing a cloak, an emerald one. Her black hair was drawn into a
tight bun. She looked distinctly ruffled.

“How did you know it was me?” she asked.
“My dear Professor, I’ve never seen a cat sit so stiffly.”
“You’d be stiff if you’d been sitting on a brick wall all day,” said Professor McGonagall.
“All day? When you could have been celebrating? I must have passed a dozen feasts and parties
on my way here.”
Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily.
“Oh yes, everyone’s celebrating, all right,” she said impatiently. “You’d think they’d be a bit
more careful, but no — even the Muggles have noticed something’s going on. It was on their
news.” She jerked her head back at the Dursleys’ dark living-room window. “I heard it. Flocks of
owls... shooting stars... Well, they’re not completely stupid. They were bound to notice
something. Shooting stars down in Kent — I’ll bet that was Dedalus Diggle. He never had much
sense.”
“You can’t blame them,” said Dumbledore gently. “We’ve had precious little to celebrate for
eleven years.”
“I know that,” said Professor McGonagall irritably. “But that’s no reason to lose our heads.
People are being downright careless, out on the streets in broad daylight, not even dressed in
Muggle clothes, swapping rumors.”
She threw a sharp, sideways glance at Dumbledore here, as though hoping he was going to tell

her something, but he didn’t, so she went on. “A fine thing it would be if, on the very day You-
Know-Who seems to have disappeared at last, the Muggles found out about us all. I suppose he

really has gone, Dumbledore?”
“It certainly seems so,” said Dumbledore. “We have much to be thankful for. Would you care for
a lemon drop?”
“A what?”
“A lemon drop. They’re a kind of Muggle sweet I’m rather fond of.”
“No, thank you,” said Professor McGonagall coldly, as though she didn’t think this was the
moment for lemon drops. “As I say, even if You-Know-Who has gone —”
“My dear Professor, surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name? All this
‘You-Know-Who’ nonsense — for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people to call
him by his proper name: Voldemort.” Professor McGonagall flinched, but Dumbledore, who was
unsticking two lemon drops, seemed not to notice. “It all gets so confusing if we keep saying
‘You-Know-Who.’ I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort’s name.”

“I know you haven’t,” said Professor McGonagall, sounding half exasperated, half admiring.
“But you’re different. Everyone knows you’re the only one You-Know- oh, all right, Voldemort,
was frightened of.”
“You flatter me,” said Dumbledore calmly. “Voldemort had powers I will never have.”
“Only because you’re too — well —noble to use them.”
“It’s lucky it’s dark. I haven’t blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new
earmuffs.”
Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said “The owls are nothing next to
the rumors that are flying around. You know what they’re saying? About why he’s disappeared?
About what finally stopped him?”
It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss, the
real reason she had been waiting on a cold, hard wall all day, for neither as a cat nor as a woman
had she fixed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now. It was plain that whatever
“everyone” was saying, she was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told her it was true.
Dumbledore, however, was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer.
“What they’re saying,” she pressed on, “is that last night Voldemort turned up in Godric’s
Hollow. He went to find the Potters. The rumor is that Lily and James Potter are — are — that
they’re — dead.”
Dumbledore bowed his head. Professor McGonagall gasped.
“Lily and James... I can’t believe it... I didn’t want to believe it... Oh, Albus...”
Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder. “I know... I know...” he said heavily.
Professor McGonagall’s voice trembled as she went on. “That’s not all. They’re saying he tried
to kill the Potter’s son, Harry. But he couldn’t. He couldn’t kill that little boy. No one knows
why, or how, but they’re saying that when he couldn’t kill Harry Potter, Voldemort’s power
somehow broke — and that’s why he’s gone.”
Dumbledore nodded glumly.
“It’s — it’s true?” faltered Professor McGonagall. “After all he’s done... all the people he’s
killed... he couldn’t kill a little boy? It’s just astounding... of all the things to stop him... but
how in the name of heaven did Harry survive?”
“We can only guess.” said Dumbledore. “We may never know.”
Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath her
spectacles. Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and

examined it. It was a very odd watch. It had twelve hands but no numbers; instead, little planets
were moving around the edge. It must have made sense to Dumbledore, though, because he put it
back in his pocket and said, “Hagrid’s late. I suppose it was he who told you I’d be here, by the
way?”
“Yes,” said Professor McGonagall. “And I don’t suppose you’re going to tell me why you’re
here, of all places?”
“I’ve come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle. They’re the only family he has left now.”
“You don’t mean – you can’t mean the people who live here?” cried Professor McGonagall,
jumping to her feet and pointing at number four. “Dumbledore — you can’t. I’ve been watching
them all day. You couldn’t find two people who are less like us. And they’ve got this son — I
saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street, screaming for sweets. Harry Potter come
and live here!”
“It’s the best place for him,” said Dumbledore firmly. “His aunt and uncle will be able to explain
everything to him when he’s older. I’ve written them a letter.”
“A letter?” repeated Professor McGonagall faintly, sitting back down on the wall. “Really,
Dumbledore, you think you can explain all this in a letter? These people will never understand
him! He’ll be famous — a legend — I wouldn’t be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter
day in the future

Message:  — there will be books written about Harry — every child in our world will
know his name!”
“Exactly.” said Dumbledore, looking very seriously over the top of his half-moon glasses. “It
would be enough to turn any boy’s head. Famous before he can walk and talk! Famous for
something he won’t even remember! Can you see how much better off he’ll be, growing up away
from all that until he’s ready to take it?”
Professor McGonagall opened her mouth, changed her mind, swallowed, and then said, “Yes —
yes, you’re right, of course. But how is the boy getting here, Dumbledore?” She eyed his cloak
suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it.
“Hagrid’s bringing him.”
“You think it —wise — to trust Hagrid with something as important as this?”
“I would trust Hagrid with my life,” said Dumbledore.
“I’m not saying his heart isn’t in the right place,” said Professor McGonagall grudgingly, “but
you can’t pretend he’s not careless. He does tend to — what was that?”
A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them. It grew steadily louder as they
looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight; it swelled to a roar as they both
looked up at the sky — and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front

of them.
If the motorcycle was huge, it was nothing to the man sitting astride it. He was almost twice as
tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide. He looked simply too big to be allowed, and
so wild — long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face, he had hands the size
of trash can lids, and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins. In his vast, muscular
arms he was holding a bundle of blankets.
“Hagrid,” said Dumbledore, sounding relieved. “At last. And where did you get that
motorcycle?”
“Borrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sir,” said the giant, climbing carefully off the motorcycle
as he spoke. “Young Sirius Black lent it to me. I’ve got him, sir.”
“No problems, were there?”
“No, sir — house was almost destroyed, but I got him out all right before the Muggles started
swarmin’ around. He fell asleep as we was flyin’ over Bristol.”
Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets. Inside, just
visible, was a baby boy, fast asleep. Under a tuft of jet-black hair over his forehead they could
see a curiously shaped cut, like a bolt of lightning.
“Is that where —?” whispered Professor McGonagall.
“Yes,” said Dumbledore. “He’ll have that scar forever.”
“Couldn’t you do something about it, Dumbledore?”
“Even if I could, I wouldn’t. Scars can come in handy. I have one myself above my left knee that
is a perfect map of the London Underground. Well — give him here, Hagrid — we’d better get
this over with.”
Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys’ house.
“Could I — could I say good-bye to him, sir?” asked Hagrid. He bent his great, shaggy head over
Harry and gave him what must have been a very scratchy, whiskery kiss. Then, suddenly, Hagrid
let out a howl like a wounded dog.
“Shhh!” hissed Professor McGonagall, “You’ll wake the Muggles!”
“S-s-sorry,” sobbed Hagrid, taking out a large, spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it.
“But I c-c-can’t stand it —Lily an’ James dead — an’ poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles
—”
“Yes, yes, it’s all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid, or we’ll be found,” Professor

McGonagall whispered, patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low
garden wall and walked to the front door. He laid Harry gently on the doorstep, took a letter out
of his cloak, tucked it inside Harry’s blankets, and then came back to the other two. For a full
minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle; Hagrid’s shoulders shook,
Professor McGonagall blinked furiously, and the twinkling light that usually shone from
Dumbledore’s eyes seemed to have gone out.
“Well,” said Dumbledore finally, “that’s that. We’ve no business staying here. We may as well
go and join the celebrations.”
“Yeah,” said Hagrid in a very muffled voice, "I best get this bike away. G’night, Professor
McGonagall — Professor Dumbledore, sir.”
Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve, Hagrid swung himself onto the motorcycle and
kicked the engine into life; with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night.
“I shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall,” said Dumbledore, nodding to her.
Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply.
Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street. On the corner he stopped and took out the
silver Put-Outer. He clicked it once, and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so
that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the
corner at the other end of the street. He could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of
number four.
“Good luck, Harry,” he murmured. He turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak, he was
gone.
A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky, the
very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen. Harry Potter rolled over inside his
blankets without waking up. One small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on, not
knowing he was special, not knowing he was famous, not knowing he would be woken in a few
hours’ time by Mrs. Dursley’s scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles,
nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley...
He couldn’t know that at this very moment, people meeting in secret all over the country were
holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices: “To Harry Potter — the boy who lived!”
19 years later
Autumn seemed to arrive suddenly that year. The morning of the first of September was crisp as an apple, and as the little family bobbed across the rumbling road toward the great sooty station, the fumes of car exhausts and the breath of pedestrians sparkled like cobwebs in the cold air. Two large cages tattled on top of the laden trolleys the parents were pushing; the owls inside them hooted indignantly, and the redheaded girl trailed fearfully behind her brothers, clutching her father's arm.
"It won't be long, and you'll be going too," Harry told her.
"Two years," sniffed Lily. "I want to go now!"
The commuters stared curiously at the owls as the family wove its way toward the barrier between platforms nine and ten, Albus's voice drifted back to Harry over the surrounding clamor; his sons had resumed the argument they had started in the car.
"I won't! I won't be a Slytherin!"
"James, give it a rest!" said Ginny.
"I only said he might be," said James, grinning at his younger brother. "There's nothing wrong with that. He might be in Slytherin"
But James caught his mother's eye and fell silent. The five Potters approached the barrier. With a slightly cocky look over his shoulder at his younger brother, James took the trolley from his mother and broke into a run. A moment later, he had vanished.
"You'll write to me, won't you?" Albus asked his parents immediately, capitalizing on the momentary absence of his brother.
"Every day, if you want us to," said Ginny.
"Not every day," said Albus quickly, "James says most people only get letters from home about once a month."
"We wrote to James three times a week last year," said Ginny.
"And you don't want to believe everything he tells you about Hogwarts," Harry put in. "He likes a laugh, your brother."
Side by side, they pushed the second trolley forward, gathering speed. As they reached the barrier, Albus winced, but no collision came. Instead, the family emerged onto platform nine and three-quarters, which was obscured by thick white steam that was
pouring from the scarlet Hogwarts Express. Indistinct figures were swarming through the mist, into which James had already disappeared.
"Where are they?" asked Albus anxiously, peering at the hazy forms they passed as they made their way down the platform.
"We'll find them," said Ginny reassuringly.
But the vapor was dense, and it was difficult to make out anybody's faces. Detached from their owners, voices sounded unnaturally loud, Harry thought he head Percy discoursing loudly on broomstick regulations, and was quite glad of the excuse not to stop and say hello. . . .
"I think that's them, Al," said Ginny suddenly.
A group of four people emerged from the mist, standing alongside the very last carriage. Their faces only came into focus when Harry, Ginny, Lily, and Albus had drawn right up to them.
"Hi," said Albus, sounding immensely relieved.
Rose, who was already wearing her brand-new Hogwarts robes, beamed at him.
"Parked all right, then?" Ron asked Harry. "I did. Hermione didn't believe I could pass a Muggle driving test, did you? She thought I'd have to Confound the examiner."
"No, I didn't," said Hermione, "I had complete faith in you."
"As a matter of fact, I did Confund him," Ron whispered to Harry, as together they lifted Albus's trunk and owl onto the train.
"I only forgot to look in the wing mirror,
and let's face it, I can use a Supersensory Charm for that."
Back on the platform, they found Lily and Hugo, Rose's younger brother, having an animated discussion about which House they would be sorted into when they finally went to Hogwarts.
"If you're not in Gryffindor, we'll disinherit you," said Ron, "but no pressure."
"Ron!"
Lily and Hugo laughed, but Albus and Rose looked solemn.
"He doesn't mean it," said Hermione and Ginny, but Ron was no longer paying attention. Catching Harry's eye, he nodded covertly to a point some fifty yards away. The steam had thinned for a moment, and three people stood in sharp relief against the shifting mist.
"Look who it is."
Draco Malfoy was standing there with his wife and son, a dark coat buttoned up to his throat. His hair was receding somewhat, which emphasized the pointed chin. The new boy resembled Draco as much as Alb

Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny staring at him, nodded curtly, and turned away again.
"So that's little Scorpius," said Ron under his breath. "Make sure you beat him in every test, Rosie. Thank God you inherited your mother's brains."
"Ron, for heaven's sake," said Hermione, half stern, half amused. "Don't try to turn them against each other before they've even started school!"
"You're right, sorry," said Ron, but unable to help himself, he added, "Don't get too friendly with him, though, Rosie. Granddad Weasley would never forgive you if you married a pureblood."
"Hey!"
James had reappeared; he had divested himself of his trunk, owl, and trolley, and was evidently bursting with news.
"Teddy's back there," he said breathlessly, pointing back over his shoulder into the billowing clouds of steam.
"Just seen him! And guess what he's doing? Snogging
Victoire!"
He gazed up at the adults, evidently disappointed by the lack of reaction.
"Our Teddy! Teddy Lupin! Snogging our Victoire! Our cousin! And I asked teddy
what he was doing --"
"You interrupted them?" said Ginny. "You are so like Ron --"
"-- and he said he'd come to see her off! And then he told me to go away. He's snogging her!" James added as though worried he had not made himself clear.
"Oh, it would be lovely if they got married!" whispered Lily ecstatically. "Teddy would really be part of the family then!"
"He already comes round for dinner about four times a week," said Harry "Why don't we just invite him to live with is and have done with it?"
"Yeah!" said James enthusiastically. "I don't mind sharing with Al--Teddy could have my room!"
"No," said Harry firmly, "you and Al will share a room only when I want the house demolished."
He checked the battered old watch that had once been Fabian Prewett's.
"It's nearly eleven, you'd better get on board."
"Don't forget to give Neville our love!" Ginny told James as she hugged him.
"Mum! I can't give a professor love!"
"But you know Neville--"
James rolled his eyes.
"Outside, yeah, but at school he's Professor Longbottom, isn't he? I can't walk into Herbology and give him love. . . ."
Shaking his head at his mother's foolishness, he vented his feelings by aiming a kick at Albus.
"See you later, Al. Watch out for the thestrals."
"I thought they were invisible? You said they were invisible!"
but James merely laughed, permitted his mother to kiss him, gave his father a fleeting hug, then leapt onto the rapidly filling train. They saw him wave, then sprint away up the corridor to find his friends.
"Thestrals are nothing to worry about," Harry told Albus. "They're gentle things, there's nothing scary about them. Anyway, you won't be going up to school in the
carriages, you'll be going in the boats."
Ginny kissed Albus good-bye.
"See you at Christmas."
"Bye, Al," said Harry as his son hugged him. "Don't forget Hagrid's invited you to tea next Friday. Don't mess with Peeves. Don't duel anyone till you've learned how. And don't let James wind you up."
"What if I'm in Slytherin?"
The whisper was for his father alone, and Harry knew that only the moment of departure could have forced Albus to reveal how great and sincere that fear was.
Harry crouched down so that Albus's face was slightly above his own. Alone of Harry's three children, Albus had inherited Lily's eyes.
"Ablus Severus," Harry said quietly, so that nobody but Ginny could hear, and she was tactful enough to pretend to be waving to rose, who was now on the train, "you were named for two headmasters of Hogwarts. One of them was a Slytherin and he was probably the bravest man I ever knew."
"But just say--"
"--then Slytherin House will have gained an excellent student, won't it? It doesn't matter to us, Al. But if it matters to you, you'll be able to choose Gryffindor over Slytherin. The Sorting Hat takes your choice into account."
"Really?"
"It did for me," said Harry.
He had never told any of his children that before, and he saw the wonder in Albus's face when he said it. But how the doors were slamming all along the scarlet train, and the blurred outlines of parents swarming forward for final kisses, last-minute reminders, Albus jumped into the carriage and ginny closed the door behind him. Students were hanging from the windows nearest them. A great number of faces, both on the train and off, seemed to be turned toward Harry.
"Why are they all staring?" demanded Albus as he and rose craned around to look at the other students.
"Don't let it worry you," said Ron. "It's me, I'm extremely famous."
Albus, Rose, Hugo, and Lily laughed. The train began to more, and Harry walked alongside it, watching his son's thin face, already ablaze with excitement. Harry kept smiling and waving, even though it was like a little bereavement, watching his son glide
away from him. . . .
The last trace of steam evaporated in the autumn air. The train rounded a corner. Harry's hand was still raised in farewell.
"He'll be alright," murmured Ginny.
As Harry looked at her, he lowered his hand absentmindedly and touched the lightning scar on his forehead.
"I know he will."
The scar had not pained Harry for nineteen years. All was well.

Plain Text: Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly
normal, thank you very much. They were the last people you’d expect to be involved in anything
strange or mysterious, because they just didn’t hold with such nonsense.
Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made drills. He was a big, beefy
man with hardly any neck, although he did have a very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin
and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she
spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbors. The Dursleys
had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere.
The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and their greatest fear was
that somebody would discover it. They didn’t think they could bear it if anyone found out about
the Potters. Mrs. Potter was Mrs. Dursley’s sister, but they hadn’t met for several years; in fact,
Mrs. Dursley pretended she didn’t have a sister, because her sister and her good-for-nothing
husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think what the
neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street. The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a
small son, too, but they had never even seen him. This boy was another good reason for keeping
the Potters away; they didn’t want Dudley mixing with a child like that.
When Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray Tuesday our story starts, there was
nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon
be happening all over the country. Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for
work, and Mrs. Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high
chair.
None of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past the window.
At half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked Mrs. Dursley on the cheek, and
tried to kiss Dudley good-bye but missed, because Dudley was now having a tantrum and
throwing his cereal at the walls.
“Little tyke,” chortled Mr. Dursley as he left the house. He got into his car and backed out of
number four’s drive.
It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar — a cat

know his name!”
“Exactly.” said Dumbledore, looking very seriously over the top of his half-moon glasses. “It
would be enough to turn any boy’s head. Famous before he can walk and talk! Famous for
something he won’t even remember! Can you see how much better off he’ll be, growing up away
from all that until he’s ready to take it?”
Professor McGonagall opened her mouth, changed her mind, swallowed, and then said, “Yes —
yes, you’re right, of course. But how is the boy getting here, Dumbledore?” She eyed his cloak
suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it.
“Hagrid’s bringing him.”
“You think it —wise — to trust Hagrid with something as important as this?”
“I would trust Hagrid with my life,” said Dumbledore.
“I’m not saying his heart isn’t in the right place,” said Professor McGonagall grudgingly, “but
you can’t pretend he’s not careless. He does tend to — what was that?”
A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them. It grew steadily louder as they

Decrypted Text: — there will be books written about Harry — every child in our world will
know his name!”
“Exactly.” said Dumbledore, looking very seriously over the top of his half-moon glasses. “It
would be enough to turn any boy’s head. Famous before he can walk and talk! Famous for
something he won’t even remember! Can you see how much better off he’ll be, growing up away
from all that until he’s ready to take it?”
Professor McGonagall opened her mouth, changed her mind, swallowed, and then said, “Yes —
yes, you’re right, of course. But how is the boy getting here, Dumbledore?” She eyed his cloak
suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it.
“Hagrid’s bringing him.”
“You think it —wise — to trust Hagrid with something as important as this?”
“I would trust Hagrid with my life,” said Dumbledore.
“I’m not saying his heart isn’t in the right place,” said Professor McGonagall grudgingly, “but
you can’t pretend he’s not careless. He does tend to — what was that?”
A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them. It grew steadily louder as they
looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight; it swelled to a roar as they both
looked up at the sky — and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front

Plain Text: us resembled Harry. Draco caught sight of
Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny staring at him, nodded curtly, and turned away again.
"So that's little Scorpius," said Ron under his breath. "Make sure you beat him in every test, Rosie. Thank God you inherited your mother's brains."
"Ron, for heaven's sake," said Hermione, half stern, half amused. "Don't try to turn them against each other before they've even started school!"
"You're right, sorry," said Ron, but unable to help himself, he added, "Don't get too friendly with him, though, Rosie. Granddad Weasley would never forgive you if you married a pureblood."
"Hey!"
James had reappeared; he had divested himself of his trunk, owl, and trolley, and was evidently bursting with news.
"Teddy's back there," he said breathlessly, pointing back over his shoulder into the billowing clouds of steam.
"Just seen him! And guess what he's doing? Snogging
Victoire!"
He gazed up at the adults, evidently disappointed by the lack of reaction.
"Our Teddy! Teddy Lupin! Snogging our Victoire! Our cousin! And I asked teddy
what he was doing --"
"You interrupted them?" said Ginny. "You are so like Ron --"
"-- and he said he'd come to see her off! And then he told me to go away. He's snogging her!" James added as though worried he had not made himself clear.
"Oh, it would be lovely if they got married!" whispered Lily ecstatically. "Teddy would really be part of the family then!"
"He already comes round for dinner about four times a week," said Harry "Why don't we just invite him to live with is and have done with it?"
"Yeah!" said James enthusiastically. "I don't mind sharing with Al--Teddy could have my room!"
"No," said Harry firmly, "you and Al will share a room only when I want the house demolished."
He checked the battered old watch that had once been Fabian Prewett's.
"It's nearly eleven, you'd better get on board."
"Don't forget to give Neville our love!" Ginny told James as she hugged him.
"Mum! I can't give a professor love!"
"But you know Neville--"
James rolled his eyes.
"Outside, yeah, but at school he's Professor Longbottom, isn't he? I can't walk into Herbology and give him love. . . ."
Shaking his head at his mother's foolishness, he vented his feelings by aiming a kick at Albus.
"See you later, Al. Watch out for the thestrals."
"I thought they were invisible? You said they were invisible!"
but James merely laughed, permitted his mother to kiss him, gave his father a fleeting hug, then leapt onto the rapidly filling train. They saw him wave, then sprint away up the corridor to find his friends.
"Thestrals are nothing to worry about," Harry told Albus. "They're gentle things, there's nothing scary about them. Anyway, you won't be going up to school in the
carriages, you'll be going in the boats."
Ginny kissed Albus good-bye.
"See you at Christmas."
"Bye, Al," said Harry as his son hugged him. "Don't forget Hagrid's invited you to tea next Friday. Don't mess with Peeves. Don't duel anyone till you've learned how. And don't let James wind you up."
"What if I'm in Slytherin?"
The whisper was for his father alone, and Harry knew that only the moment of departure could have forced Albus to reveal how great and sincere that fear was.
Harry crouched down so that Albus's face was slightly above his own. Alone of Harry's three children, Albus had inherited Lily's eyes.
"Ablus Severus," Harry said quietly, so that nobody but Ginny could hear, and she was tactful enough to pretend to be waving to rose, who was now on the train, "you were named for two headmasters of Hogwarts. One of them was a Slytherin and he was probably the bravest man I ever knew."
"But just say--"
"--then Slytherin House will have gained an excellent student, won't it? It doesn't matter to us, Al. But if it matters to you, you'll be able to choose Gryffindor over Slytherin. The Sorting Hat takes your choice into account."
"Really?"
"It did for me," said Harry.
He had never told any of his children that before, and he saw the wonder in Albus's face when he said it. But how the doors were slamming all along the scarlet train, and the blurred outlines of parents swarming forward for final kisses, last-minute reminders, Albus jumped into the carriage and ginny closed the door behind him. Students were hanging from the windows nearest them. A great number of faces, both on the train and off, seemed to be turned toward Harry.
"Why are they all staring?" demanded Albus as he and rose craned around to look at the other students.
"Don't let it worry you," said Ron. "It's me, I'm extremely famous."
Albus, Rose, Hugo, and Lily laughed. The train began to more, and Harry walked alongside it, watching his son's thin face, already ablaze with excitement. Harry kept smiling and waving, even though it was like a little bereavement, watching his son glide
away from him. . . .
The last trace of steam evaporated in the autumn air. The train rounded a corner. Harry's hand was still raised in farewell.
"He'll be alright," murmured Ginny.
As Harry looked at her, he lowered his hand absentmindedly and touched the lightning scar on his forehead.
"I know he will."
The scar had not pained Harry for nineteen years. All was well.

Decrypted Text: us resembled Harry. Draco caught sight of
Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny staring at him, nodded curtly, and turned away again.
"So that's little Scorpius," said Ron under his breath. "Make sure you beat him in every test, Rosie. Thank God you inherited your mother's brains."
"Ron, for heaven's sake," said Hermione, half stern, half amused. "Don't try to turn them against each other before they've even started school!"
"You're right, sorry," said Ron, but unable to help himself, he added, "Don't get too friendly with him, though, Rosie. Granddad Weasley would never forgive you if you married a pureblood."
"Hey!"
James had reappeared; he had divested himself of his trunk, owl, and trolley, and was evidently bursting with news.
"Teddy's back there," he said breathlessly, pointing back over his shoulder into the billowing clouds of steam.
"Just seen him! And guess what he's doing? Snogging
Victoire!"
He gazed up at the adults, evidently disappointed by the lack of reaction.
"Our Teddy! Teddy Lupin! Snogging our Victoire! Our cousin! And I asked teddy
what he was doing --"
"You interrupted them?" said Ginny. "You are so like Ron --"
"-- and he said he'd come to see her off! And then he told me to go away. He's snogging her!" James added as though worried he had not made himself clear.
"Oh, it would be lovely if they got married!" whispered Lily ecstatically. "Teddy would really be part of the family then!"
"He already comes round for dinner about four times a week," said Harry "Why don't we just invite him to live with is and have done with it?"
"Yeah!" said James enthusiastically. "I don't mind sharing with Al--Teddy could have my room!"
"No," said Harry firmly, "you and Al will share a room only when I want the house demolished."
He checked the battered old watch that had once been Fabian Prewett's.
"It's nearly eleven, you'd better get on board."
"Don't forget to give Neville our love!" Ginny told James as she hugged him.
"Mum! I can't give a professor love!"
"But you know Neville--"
James rolled his eyes.
"Outside, yeah, but at school he's Professor Longbottom, isn't he? I can't walk into Herbology and give him love. . . ."
Shaking his head at his mother's foolishness, he vented his feelings by aiming a kick at Albus.
"See you later, Al. Watch out for the thestrals."
"I thought they were invisible? You said they were invisible!"
but James merely laughed, permitted his mother to kiss him, gave his father a fleeting hug, then leapt onto the rapidly filling train. They saw him wave, then sprint away up the corridor to find his friends.
"Thestrals are nothing to worry about," Harry told Albus. "They're gentle things, there's nothing scary about them. Anyway, you won't be going up to school in the
carriages, you'll be going in the boats."
Ginny kissed Albus good-bye.
"See you at Christmas."
"Bye, Al," said Harry as his son hugged him. "Don't forget Hagrid's invited you to tea next Friday. Don't mess with Peeves. Don't duel anyone till you've learned how. And don't let James wind you up."
"What if I'm in Slytherin?"
The whisper was for his father alone, and Harry knew that only the moment of departure could have forced Albus to reveal how great and sincere that fear was.
Harry crouched down so that Albus's face was slightly above his own. Alone of Harry's three children, Albus had inherited Lily's eyes.
"Ablus Severus," Harry said quietly, so that nobody but Ginny could hear, and she was tactful enough to pretend to be waving to rose, who was now on the train, "you were named for two headmasters of Hogwarts. One of them was a Slytherin and he was probably the bravest man I ever knew."
"But just say--"
"--then Slytherin House will have gained an excellent student, won't it? It doesn't matter to us, Al. But if it matters to you, you'll be able to choose Gryffindor over Slytherin. The Sorting Hat takes your choice into account."
"Really?"
"It did for me," said Harry.
He had never told any of his children that before, and he saw the wonder in Albus's face when he said it. But how the doors were slamming all along the scarlet train, and the blurred outlines of parents swarming forward for final kisses, last-minute reminders, Albus jumped into the carriage and ginny closed the door behind him. Students were hanging from the windows nearest them. A great number of faces, both on the train and off, seemed to be turned toward Harry.
"Why are they all staring?" demanded Albus as he and rose craned around to look at the other students.
"Don't let it worry you," said Ron. "It's me, I'm extremely famous."
Albus, Rose, Hugo, and Lily laughed. The train began to more, and Harry walked alongside it, watching his son's thin face, already ablaze with excitement. Harry kept smiling and waving, even though it was like a little bereavement, watching his son glide
away from him. . . .
The last trace of steam evaporated in the autumn air. The train rounded a corner. Harry's hand was still raised in farewell.
"He'll be alright," murmured Ginny.
As Harry looked at her, he lowered his hand absentmindedly and touched the lightning scar on his forehead.
"I know he will."
The scar had not pained Harry for nineteen years. All was well.
